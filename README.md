# "Caption" as a Coherence Relation: Evidence and Implications[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332247174_Caption_as_a_Coherence_Relation_Evidence_and_Implications]


## Introduction

We study verbs in image--text corpora, contrasting caption corpora, where texts are explicitly written to characterize image content, with depiction corpora, where texts and images may stand in more general relations. Captions show a distinctively limited distribution of verbs,  with strong preferences for specific tense, aspect, lexical aspect, and semantic field.  These limitations, which appear in data elicited by a range of methods, restrict the utility of caption corpora to inform image retrieval, multimodal document generation, and perceptually-grounded semantic models.  We suggest that these limitations reflect the discourse constraints in play when subjects write texts to accompany imagery, so we argue that future development of image--text corpora should work to increase the diversity of event descriptions, while looking explicitly at the different ways text and imagery can be coherently related.
